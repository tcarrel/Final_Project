 * \brief This is the base class that all commands must inherit from.  It is
 * simply a virtual interface for all the other commands.  The interface for
 * this program uses the Command pattern because it allows the end user to
 * customize their controls and because in its eventual form, will allow for
 * commands to be received from sources other than the player.  For example,
 * from an AI class or over a network for some version of multiplayer.
